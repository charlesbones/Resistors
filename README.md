<h1>Resistors</h1></br>
Simple tool for Arduino/Wiring to make easier the process of understanding the resistors color code. All the graphic content is based on <a href=http://fritzing.org/home/ target=_blank>FRITZING</a> components.</br>

So far ir has been tested with Arduino 1.6.6.
</br>
<h2>Instructions</h2></br>
The instalation process is really simple. You just have to download the files, rename the main folder as Resistors and place it inside the tools folder within the Arduino folder.</br>
Note:
<ul>
<li>if there isn't any tools folder just create it.</li>
</ul>
